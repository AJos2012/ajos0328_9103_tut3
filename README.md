## Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration 
#### *Fractal Art*

Fractal art captivates me because it can generate endlessly complex, recursive patterns from fundamental mathematical principles. The self-similarity of fractal patterns, which repeat at different scales, reflects the beauty of natural forms such as trees, coastlines, and mountains. For my assignment, I plan to use fractal patterns to give depth and complexity to my designs. This technique reflects the project's emphasis on iteration and repetition, allowing complex graphics to develop from object oriented programming. This technique allows for the production of dynamic and developing designs, which can provide a sense of surprise and unpredictability to the artwork.

## Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration
#### *Recursive Functions*
Recursive functions are necessary for generating fractal patterns because they repeatedly call themselves with slightly adjusted parameters, resulting in self-similar structures. In my project, a recursive function would help me produce sophisticated fractal designs by breaking down complex structures into smaller, recurring units. This coding style complements the course's emphasis on loops and iteration, allowing the development of visually complex patterns with minimal code. Using recursion, I can create fractals that evolve dynamically, resulting in the natural, recursive complexity that defines fractal art.
